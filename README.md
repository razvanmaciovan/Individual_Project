# Ephemeral
Unity project made for my 3rd semester PI university course.  
You can download the game from my [itch.io](https://xpanderex.itch.io/ephemeral) page, or you can get a direct link from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1183oZtm5cdmeCfTDJVN9wJ_YPFGW6HZr/view).  
It is a 2D Dungeon Crawler RPG, made using Unity and C#.  
- The coding for this project was made using various design patterns suchs as, but not limited to, singleton, unit of work pattern and state machine pattern.
- The save system was implemented using [PlayerPrefs](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/PlayerPrefs.html) from MonoBehaviour and the [BinarryFormatter](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.runtime.serialization.formatters.binary.binaryformatter?view=net-6.0) from .NET, to save the progress locally on the machine, the location being based on the operating system.
- Pixel art created by hand
- AI realised with Pathfinding using [NavMesh](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/AI.NavMesh.html)
#### Development status : ON HOLD
